# Project-5--Corona-Cases-Switzerland

In this exercise, you will access, process, and visualize the second-phase covid-19 data in Switzerland. The
goal of this exercise is to visualize and compare the daily cases increase for each of the cantons in

T1.2: Calculate daily new cases for each canton, and smooth it with a rolling window.
T1.3: Construct a ColumnDataSource for plotting according to the task descriptions in the code
skeleton.

Task2: Data Visualization.
T2.1: Implement plotting functions using the ColumnDataSource as the input, draw a group of line
charts on the same plot, each line corresponds to daily new cases of a canton.
T2.2: Add a clickable legend and hovering tooltips to the plot in order to provide more detailed
information.
